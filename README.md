# RadLib

RadLib is a collection of Lua utility functions for [Corona SDK](http://www.coronalabs.com) development.

The original tests were written in Test::More, but I have started rewriting them in busted (http://olivinelabs.com/busted/).
If you want to contribute and learn Lua testing at the same time, the easiest way to do so is by helping out in rewriting the tests.
